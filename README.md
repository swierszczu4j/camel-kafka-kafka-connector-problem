# Camel Kafka Kafka Connector Problem Showcase

Simple project showcasing the
[Camel Kafka Kafka Connector issue](https://github.com/apache/camel-kafka-connector/issues/988).
The problem is, that the connector is not passing forward the message key that comes from the inbound topic.

[EDIT] After changes introduced by [Andrea](https://github.com/oscerd) (thank U very much) it's working and
tests are passing!

## Intro

This project contains simple Spring Boot app with ShowcaseTest, which is currently ~~failing expecting the connector not
to lose the message key in between~~ working. You can also see exactly the same behavior using prepared docker-compose file, and
while running the DemoApplication, in the logs you will see that on the outbound topic the key is ~~missing~~ there.

## How to set it up?

1. Run `setup.sh` - downloads the connector and places it in connectors folder.
2. Run `docker-compose up -d` - to make the whole infra work.
3. Run `register-camel-connector.sh` - registers the Camel Kafka Kafka Connector.
4. Build app using `mvn clean package -DskipTests`.
5. Run the app using `mvn spring-boot:run`.
6. Run `sample-request.sh` to see the ~~issue~~ working solution in the console.

OR

Build the project with `mvn clean package` and see that the ShowcaseTest is
~~failing due to missing key in outbound topic~~ passing.
